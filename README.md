# A2plusmore
Here are three programs that I use with A2plus Assembly program. I have combined them into a workbench. If you think they might be useful you can download the A2plusmore plus directions.zip using the link to the right.

In “Auto On”, when selecting features for constraints I use the left mouse button only (DO NOT use the control key) after select a feature from two parts a “default” constraint is automatically selected to connect the two parts. If you do not want the default constraint simply pick the constraint you want from the active constraints before you select the parts. This process is similar to how SolidWorks selections work so if you are accustomed to using SolidWorks it will be familiar to you.

The orange update button updates parts that have been modified. Features that are attached to the constraint are recorded before the part is updated. After the update the constraint is attached to these features instead of being attached to the feature’s Name. This reduces the number of errors when updating modified parts. If you have changed only dimensions in the part use the normal update tool in A2+, if you have added holes or changed a part physically. Try this update tool.

The lantern icon is for viewing constraints and fixing constraint problems. You can also move the leg of a constraint from one feature to another. You can view how to use this this constraint viewer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9y3a0fKtoA&t=38s
More instructions for these programs are in the zipped file.

I don't write for FreecCAD nor do I represent them. These are 3rd party programs that I have written for my own use but anyone is welcomed to use them.
